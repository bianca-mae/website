                        In a nutshell: sustainable and ethical fashion is an approach towards sourcing, 
                        manufacturing and designing clothes which maximizes the benefits to the fashion 
                        industry and society at large, while at the same time minimizing its impact on 
                        the environment. The two concepts overlap in ideology, but they each have slightly 
                        different concerns, both equally critical to the future of fashion.

                        The industry uses 93 billion cubic meters of water per year.
                        It takes 3,781 liters of water to make one pair of jeans.
                        Of all the wastewater in the world, 20% is from textile dying and is highly toxic—many countries where clothes are made have reduced or no regulations for wastewater disposal.
                        Microplastic fibers used in clothing make their way to the ocean, amounting to about 500,000 tons—close to 50 billion plastic bottles.
                        Fashion emits more than 10% of global carbon emissions.

                        <p>Because it must be cheap, fast fashion is dependent <br> 
                        on the exploited labor force in developing countries <br>
                        where regulations are lax. Workers are underpaid, <br>
                        overworked, and exposed to dangerous conditions or <br>
                        health hazards; many are underage. Of the 75 million <br> 
                        factory workers around the world, it's estimated that <br>
                        only two percent earn a living wage. To keep brands <br>
                        from moving to another country or region with lower <br>
                        costs, factories limit wages and are disinclined to <br>
                        spend money to improve working conditions. <br>
                        Moreover, workers often live in areas with waterways <br>
                        polluted by the chemicals from textile dyeing. </p>

                            When clothes made from synthetics are washed,<br>
                            microplastics from their fibers are shed into the <br>
                            wastewater. Some of it is filtered out at wastewater <br>
                            treatment plants along with human waste and the <br>
                            resulting sludge is used as fertilizer for agriculture. <br>
                            Microplastics then enter the soil and become part <br>
                            of the food chain. The microplastics that elude the <br>
                            treatment plant end up in rivers and oceans, and <br>
                            in the atmosphere when seawater droplets carry <br>
                            them into the air. It's estimated that 35 percent of <br>
                            the microplastics in the ocean come from the <br>
                            fashion industry. While some brands use <br>
                            “recycled polyester” from PET bottles, which emits <br>
                            50 to 25 percent fewer emissions than virgin <br>
                            polyester, effective polyester recycling is limited, <br>
                            so after use, these garments still usually end up in <br>
                            the landfill where they can shed microfibers. <br>
                            Microplastics harm marine life, as well as birds and <br>
                            turtles. They have already been found in our food, <br>
                            water and air—one study found that Americans eat <br>
                            74,000 microplastic particles each year. And while <br>
                            there is growing concern about this, the risks to <br>
                            human health are still not well understood.

                        To feed the fashion industry's need for wood pulp to <br>
                        make fabrics like rayon, viscose and other fabrics, <br>
                        70 million tons of trees are cut down each year. That <br>
                        number is expected to double by 2034, speeding <br>
                        deforestation in some of the world's endangered <br>
                        forests. <br> <br>

                        The fashion industry produces 1.2 million metric tons <br>
                        of CO2 each year, according to a MacArthur <br>
                        Foundation study. In 2018, it resulted in more <br>
                        greenhouse gas emissions than the carbon <br>
                        produced by France, Germany and the UK all <br>
                        together. Polyester, which is actually plastic made <br>
                        from fossil fuels, is used for about 65 percent of all <br>
                        clothing, and consumes 70 million barrels of oil each <br>
                        year. In addition, the fashion industry uses large <br>
                        amounts of fossil fuel-based plastic for packaging <br>
                        and hangers.

                            It's all about planning. Buying better quality, more sustainable pieces is likely to cost you more 
                            money than buying a cheap high-street product that doesn't tick the right boxes. However, it's all 
                            about changing your mindset. Yes, it costs more, but you're likely to have it for longer and will 
                            be buying less per season overall. Buying just a few high-quality items a year, rather than lots of 
                            cheaper, less eco-friendly pieces, will dramatically reduce your carbon footprint. Basically, save up, 
                            invest and buy less.

                            Shop locally. Buy from local shops for clothes, buy from local craftspeople to accessorize your outfits 
                            and use your neighborhood tailor for adjustments.

                            <br>
                            Earth-friendly benefit: Buying clothes locally reduces carbon emissions from shipping while supporting 
                            your local economy.

                            Donating your unwanted clothes to a good cause, rather than leaving them hanging in your wardrobe, 
                            will help others to be more sustainable; they will invest in your old pieces, rather than buying 
                            something new. A great way to do this is to have a one-in, one-out policy - live by the mantra that 
                            every time you buy something, you'll donate something.
                        </p>
